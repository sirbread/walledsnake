# Snake Game

**WINDOWS ONLY. Sorry to my beloved Linux users!**
This is a simple Snake game written in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface and the Pillow library to generate the game grid and set the wallpaper. The game will run on Windows and set the game board as the desktop wallpaper.

## Instructions

1. **Start the Game:**
   - Simply run the Python script to start the Snake game.
   - The control window should pop up automatically.

2. **Gameplay:**
   - Use the arrow buttons in the control window to move the snake:
     - **Left Arrow (←)**: Move the snake left.
     - **Up Arrow (↑)**: Move the snake up.
     - **Down Arrow (↓)**: Move the snake down.
     - **Right Arrow (→)**: Move the snake right.
   - The game will generate food (red squares) on the grid.
   - The snake (green squares) grows longer as it eats food.
   - The game ends if the snake hits the boundaries of the grid or itself.

3. **Score:**
   - Your score will increase each time the snake eats food.
   - The score is displayed at the bottom of the control window.

4. **Retry:**
   - If the game ends, click the **Retry** button (⟳) to start a new game.
   - The score will reset to 0.

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: You can also use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake:
  - Left Arrow (←)

  - Down Arrow (↓)
  - Right Arrow (→)
